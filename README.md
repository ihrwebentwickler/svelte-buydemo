# Buy-Demo (Svelte)
This app serves as a reference for the best possible implementation of a store environment. Individual items can be
placed in a shopping cart via a product page and the quantity can be changed via the basket page.

# Installation
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
